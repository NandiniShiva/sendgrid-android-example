sendgrid-android-example
========================

This code is not production ready. It is meant to help you integrate quickly with SendGrid. You will need to incorporate error handling and testing.

The easiest way to get started with this example is to:

* Clone the repo
* Modify the UtilsDEFAULT.java file as described in the file
* Compile and run the code

# Sending Email

* Make sure you include the `uses-permissions` tag in your AndroidManifest.xml like [so](https://github.com/thinkingserious/sendgrid-android-example/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml).
* Check out the code in [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/thinkingserious/sendgrid-android-example/blob/master/src/com/thinkingserious/sendgrid/MainActivity.java)
* Review the [SendGrid Java library](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java).

# Retrieving Statistics

* Review the code in [DisplayMessageActivity.java](https://github.com/thinkingserious/sendgrid-android-example/blob/master/src/com/thinkingserious/sendgrid/DisplayMessageActivity.java)
* Review the [SendGrid Web API stats endpoint](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/Statistics/index.html).

If you create something cool, let us know so we can include you in the [SendGrid Developer Community](http://sendgrid.com/developers/developers).
